# GitHub Release Plan

## Repository Name

`vibe-launch-review`

## Tagline

The last launch safety gate for vibe-coded apps.

## Description

Focused Codex skill for reviewing vibe-coded or AI-generated apps before public launch. It checks five launch risks: SMS/email abuse, UGC moderation, image/file upload risk, AI prompt/model-call exposure, and demo-to-public-product gaps. When user files, AI inputs, model outputs, or logs matter, it adds a short data/privacy handling feedback block without claiming legal-compliance certification.

## Suggested GitHub Topics

- `agent-skills`
- `codex`
- `vibe-coding`
- `ai-agents`
- `launch-review`
- `app-security`
- `developer-tools`

## Current Release

Release tag: `v0.2.1`

Release focus: data/privacy handling feedback inside the existing five-gate workflow, functional validation coverage for that feedback, and clearer release notes for controlled pilots versus public self-serve launch.

Artifacts:

- `vibe-launch-review.skill`
- `vibe-launch-review-github-source.zip`
- `vibe-launch-review-SHA256SUMS.txt`

Do not upload the generic `packages/dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`; it may belong to another package.
